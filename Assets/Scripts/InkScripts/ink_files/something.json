He describes Zebraman, AKA, Zanthos Colt, lost and alone. He has just divorced the woman he thought was the love of his life, Giraffewoman, AKA, Giselle Heart. He tried to save civilians from a burning building the other day, but it was a disaster. The building collapsed and he almost got crushed. He severely injured his arm.","\n","^The doctors say he needs to rest but he can’t accept the crushing failure. He almost wishes he got crushed by that building. Crime is on the up, the mafia still runs Savannahland and they are surrounded by suffering and chaos.","\n","^Despite his injuries, he still turns up to the bank that is being robbed the next day (the criminals are on a tight schedule here) and he tells them to stop, he uses his super fast zebra sprint. But the huge mafia dude hits him in the arm. He screams in pain. He is no longer invincible. The civilians in the bank look at him with pity in their eyes. He can’t meet their gaze. He is a weak pathetic beta male.","\n","^Suddenly there is a commotion. At least, more of a commotion than usual. Someone runs in a tight gold leather gimp–I mean a tight fitting superhero costume. She has the mask, as usual, little gold ears poking out of the top. It’s cute, I mean cute in a sexy way. Her gold eyes smoulder beneath her mask. She gets out her signature, gold whip. For a second, she looks at Zanthos, dead in the eyes. Then she winks. Her arms strike out faster than Zanthos can register, and the mafia dude’s head falls off his shoulders. There are screams everywhere. Somewhere from inside, Zanthos gets the courage to stand up. He’s not Zanthos, he’s Zebraman. And he’s here to fuck shit up.","\n","^They make light work of the bank. But when it’s over, he turns around to where Lionessa was dismembering a man. She is gone. The police congratulate Zebraman again, but the victory is hollow. Where is she? Why did she just leave like that?","\n","^Zebraman doesn’t have a lot of friends, he’s a solitary kind of guy. That’s the life he’s chosen. When Giraffewoman left him that was it. He imagined he would die on the job. That would be preferable to rotting alone.","\n","^He takes off his blazer and jumps on the king sized bed. He can already feel the aches and pains that accompany him after a job. Then, in the corner of his eye he sees something. A glint of gold in his periphery. He looks at the window but there is nothing there. He sighs and goes out to the balcony. She joins him soon after, a flask of coffee in her hand.","\n","^“What are you doing here Aura?”","\n","^“Is that your way of saying thank you?”","\n","^“I don’t need your help.”","\n","^“You’re a broken man, Zan.”","\n","^“And you think you can fix me?”","\n","^“Fix you?” She laughs, it’s like smoke and honey. “No, I’m not so naive. But I want to help you.”","\n","^“Why would you do that?”","\n","^“Friends help each other.”","\n","^“Friends? What makes you think we’re friends?”","\n","^“You haven’t kicked me off this balcony yet.”","\n","^“Don’t tempt me.”","\n","^He tries his gruff voice. It doesn’t work.","\n","^She drops a duffle bag on the floor.","\n","^“What’s in there?” He raises an eyebrow. “Did you steal money from the bank? Shame on you, preying on innocent people. Taking advantage of a situation like that.”","\n","^“Banks aren’t innocent you fucking moron. And it’s not money.”","\n","^“Then what is it?”","\n","^She grins.","\n","^“What’s in the bag Aura?”","\n","^Her grin widens.","\n","^Zanthos opens the bag, inside are…well. Handcuffs.","\n","^“What’s the meaning of this? Did you steal these from the police?”","\n","^“Yes Zan, I went to all that trouble to steal a pair of handcuffs from the police.”","\n","^Zanthos rummaged a bit more through the bag, there were other things in the bag. Silicone things. Mostly.","\n","^He looks up at Aura, she’s still holding the flask of coffee, but her other hand gently strokes the gilded whip that’s always strapped to her waist.","\n","^“So you’re one of those…perverts.”","\n","^In one move she strikes out, slamming him to the wall. Not as hard as he expected though. He doesn’t move, instead planning his counterattack. She doesn’t do anything else though…she just holds him there.","\n","^“You hate everyone. You hate everything. You hate this city. You hate your ex-wife. You hate your parents. You hate…you hate me.”","\n","^“Well, that last one is a given. I disagree with all the others though.”","\n","^“You don’t save this city out of love, just duty. And you’ve grown to resent it now. You’re tired.”","\n","^“What has this got to do with you?”","\n","^“The hate is killing you. Why not just let go?”","\n","^“I can’t let go.”","\n","^“Because of your stupid pride.”","\n","^“No. It’s not that.”","\n","^“Then what? What is it?”","\n","^“I don’t know how to let go.”","\n","^She stopped for a second, examining him carefully. She moves forward, her lips brushing his. The warmth is unexpected, but surprisingly welcome. He grabs her and pulls her towards him, but she pushes him away.","\n","^“Not like that.”","\n","^“Like what then?”","\n","^She puts her hand on her chin. Then she grabs his shoulder. “Get on your knees.”","\n","^“Why?”","\n","^“Do you want to know how to let go?”","\n","^“Yes.”","\n","^“Then relinquish control to me.”","\n","^“I can’t.”","\n","^“What do you have to lose?”","\n","^He gets down on his knees. The ground is cold and hard. He wishes he’d furnished the place a little bit, a little mat would have done wonders. Maybe a little one with birds and flowers. That’s what Giselle would have gone. But Giselle was gone, and all her little feminine trinkets were gone with her.","\n","^“Who am I?”","\n","^“A thief. A criminal. A violent murderer.”","\n","^“What? No, I never murdered anyone…who didn’t deserve it at least.” She wrinkles her nose. “What do you call me?”","\n","^“Evil femme fatale lady who keeps ruining my life.”","\n","^“Hmm, you’re not quite getting this. Quite slow. Never mind, I find a bit of punishment helps. You don’t mind if I slap you right?”","\n","^“Slap me you sick bitch.” He wasn’t sure where the words were coming from. Somewhere deep in his soul, some dark hole where he’d buried his intense feelings of self hatred and loathing.","\n","^The slap came and he found himself gasping. It was just a slap, not even a hard one. Why was he breathing so fast?","\n","^She put one of her feet on the balcony chair. “It’s Mistress to you.” She smirked. “I bet Giselle never did that.”","\n","^“Keep her name out of your mouth.”","\n","^The slap came again out of nowhere. “Oh dear, you really don’t understand do you. It’s rude to talk back.”","\n","^“What are you going to do to me, Mistress?”","\n","^“I haven’t decided yet. I mean, sure I’ve been thinking about it for months. I get all these ideas, but I thought you were so boring. You wouldn’t follow through. No way, Zanthos would ever do that.”","\n","^“I…might be interested.”","\n","^“Might? Might isn’t good enough.”","\n","^“I want you to fuck me.”","\n","^“Hmm, too strong.”","\n","^“Please will you fuck me.”","\n","^“Uh, better. Try to beg more. Use fuck less, it’s a bit impolite you know.”","\n","^Polite? What did manners matter when they were doing…this kind of stuff?","\n","^“Dear Aura, Please can you give me pleasure, in whatever way you find possible. I look forward to your response. Kind regards, Zanthos.”","\n","^“Don’t be snarky.”","\n","^“Should I have put some kisses at the end?”","\n","^Another slap.","\n","^“You’re really bad at this. But don’t worry, you’ll learn. They all do in the end.”</i>","\n","ev",{"VAR?":"comic"},"/ev",{"VAR=":"currentSpeaker","re":true},"^I’m done reading, this is just the first chapter.
